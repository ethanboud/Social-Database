## Description
This is an application that utilizes MongoDB for API calls to the database for various CRUD inputs. It involves the creation of users, the creation of thoughts of those users, reactions of the thoughts of the users, and friends of users. Each aspect includes inputs to create, read, update, and delete.

## Installation
Download the files and open the terminal at the "main" level. Once here, run "npm i" to download all dependencies. 

## Usage
Once all node modules and dependencies have downloaded, run the application by typing "npm run start". This will run the application locally. From here, navigate to a CRUD application such as Insomnia to test the routes. The routes can be found in the api directory located in the following path:\Main\src\outes\api. Once here, try out the POST, GET, UPDATE, and DELETE routes. The structure for the json input (when required) can be found in the controllers files.

## Contribution
Use this as a template when building your own routes to access a database for your own application! Controllers will need to be updated but the routes will remain fairly similar. If you have any additions or changes you would recommend feel free to email them to me. 

## Test
Run the application and test the POST, GET, UPDATE, and DELETE commands as outlined in the usage instructions.
